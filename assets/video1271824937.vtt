00:00.080 --> 00:01.720
Let me ask you this.

00:01.720 --> 00:04.080
Do you see yourself as a leader?

00:04.080 --> 00:07.080
Think back to a time
when you guided or supported others.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.040
Maybe you led a project.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.120
Helped a friend make a decision
or simply stepped up when it mattered.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.560
What did that feel like?

00:14.560 --> 00:17.160
Did others recognize your leadership

00:17.160 --> 00:19.600
or did your effort go unnoticed?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.800
Go ahead. Take a second.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.240
Think about it.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.240
You can pause the video if you want to.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.680
So, did a moment pop into your head
right away?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.400
Or are you sitting there thinking,
nope, not me?

00:39.240 --> 00:42.520
It might be difficult to think
of a specific leadership experience

00:42.840 --> 00:45.840
simply
because leadership is often misunderstood.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.640
Many of us hold misconceptions
about what it truly means to be a leader.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.560
The Cambridge Dictionary defines
a leader as a person

00:54.560 --> 00:57.600
in control of a group, country,
or situation.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.520
For many people, leadership
is tied to titles, hierarchy, and power.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.080
Think of words like boss
authority and giving orders.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.560
But is that really all leadership is?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.000
When we think of leaders.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.040
We often picture CEOs, basketball coaches,

01:15.040 --> 01:18.040
school principals,
or even the Prime Minister of Canada.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.760
But leadership exists
beyond titles and authority.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.760
It's about impact.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.640
Some of the common

01:25.640 --> 01:29.280
myths about leadership might be holding
you back from recognizing this.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.320
Let's debunk them together.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.440
Myth number one
leaders must be extroverts.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.280
It's easy to picture a leader
as someone bold, outspoken,

01:38.520 --> 01:40.200
and always in the spotlight.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.680
But in reality, effective leaders come in
all personality types.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.720
Leadership isn't
about being the loudest voice in the room.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.720
It's about knowing your strengths
and using them.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.080
Introverts, for example, often
excel at deep thinking,

01:53.240 --> 01:56.640
listening, and building strong
one on one relationships.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.480
The best leaders adapt
to their own unique strengths.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.680
Whether they're introverted
or extroverted.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.960
Myth number two.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.960
Leadership means making all the decisions.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.480
A common misconception is
that leaders have to call all the shots.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.120
But great leadership isn't about control.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.040
It's about trust.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.040
The best leaders empower
others, encourage collaboration,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.360
and guide their teams
through coaching and support.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.320
Instead of having all the answers,

02:25.320 --> 02:28.520
they create an environment
where everyone contributes and grows.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.440
Myth number three only managers can lead.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.480
Leadership isn't defined by a job title.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.520
It exists at all levels.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.520
Whether you're a manager, an intern,
or anywhere in between.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.120
True leaders step up, take initiative,

02:45.120 --> 02:48.120
and inspire change
no matter their position.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.960
You don't need a title to make an impact.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.760
You just need the willingness to lead.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.280
Meet Alex.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.360
She's an analyst at a tech company
and individual

02:58.360 --> 03:01.360
contributor
with no formal leadership title.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.440
But she has an idea.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.440
For three years, Alex has been thinking
about a new initiative

03:06.800 --> 03:09.240
that could improve the way her team works.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.520
She's passionate about it and believes
it could make a real difference.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.080
But there's a challenge.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.440
She's never led a project before
in her workplace.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.880
Leadership usually comes with a title.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.720
And since no one around her
has taken the lead with that one,

03:23.720 --> 03:26.720
the idea of stepping up
feels intimidating.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.320
Doubts creep in.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.480
Who am I to lead this?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.400
How do I even get started?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.080
What if no one listens?

03:34.080 --> 03:37.280
What Alex doesn't realize
is that leadership starts with a vision.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.800
The fact that she sees a need
and has an idea to address it.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.280
That's the first step.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.720
Now think back to your answer earlier.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.880
Do you consider yourself a leader?

03:47.880 --> 03:51.040
Like Alex, you might already be leading
in ways you haven't recognized.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.880
So what kind of leader do you want to be?

03:55.280 --> 03:58.280
In this course,
you'll explore your core values.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.120
Discover
what leadership means to you and decide

04:01.120 --> 04:03.720
what kind of impact you want to make.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.160
Truth is, many leaders
step up before they feel ready.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.600
Maybe it's your time to step up to.
